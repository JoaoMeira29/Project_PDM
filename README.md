# Kotlin/Android Project

### Academic goals

With the realization of this project, we hope to apply all the knowledge learned in the classes, knowledge about
managing, planning and execute a project from start to finish, work with the team, utilizing agile methods like Scrum to
organize the team/work environment.

### Business context

This project was developed by *Campex*, a housing company, that created *UniHome* to rich the goal of facilitating the
control of the university residences, by allowing its users to use an app for everything related to the residence.
The application allows administrators to manage the entry of students into the residence and students to apply for
rooms. Once accepted, students have access to several features in the application and many smart devices to make
their lives easier. This service will also facilitate the work of the administrator of each residence, by allowing
through a chat to communicate with the students about any problems, this also goes the other way around if the user
have any complaints or requests to make.
Some of that features are the possibility to open the room door, which uses a Smart Lock, via the app, without the need
for physical keys, control the heating in the room, using a smart air conditioning, so that students can have a
comfortable environment during the seasons, being alerted by a notification when an order is received at the room
locker, etc.
All students can schedule a cleaning service if they want to, but it will carry an extra cost. Those extra fees need to
be paid within the app, as well as the normal rent of the room.
For students, UniHome offers greater convenience and security thanks to its additional functionalities and aims to be
easy to use. For universities, this could be good to attract more students, and provide better comfort allowing students
to be more invested in their studies

### Project vision

**“To provide a way to be a second home”** – This project aims to make life easier for its users by being able to control
their room, from anywhere, using an application and take advantage of a more digital world. The app would allow the use
of smart appliances to notify, facilitate and accelerate actions in the lives of students
